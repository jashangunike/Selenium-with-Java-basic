Android Studio is a version of JetBrain's IntelliJ Community Edition specifically tailored for Android development. Installation instructions for Android Studio can be found here.

IntelliJ IDEA contains all the features found in Android Studio. Setup for Android development is, however, a bit more involved since it does not include the Android SDK by default.

Prerequisites
Install Java 7 JDK
Install IntelliJ IDEA
Install Android SDK Tools
Install Genymotion
